<b>Best practice:</b>
</p>
<p>
Best practices are general techniques or styles used when developing
 webpages, they are used so that if another developer must edit
 or look at a website they will recognise the structure of the 
 code with little effort. An example of this is using only one
 stylesheet and one JavaScript document for the whole webpage,
 this ensures that like tags all look the same and all instances
 of JavaScript function in the same manor.
Throughout the project W3 validator was used to check the 
validity of practices used. These include such things as 
placing title tags in the head of an HTML page rather than
 between the head and body.
</p>
<p>
<b>Web standards:</b>
</p>
<p>
Web standards, are standards followed by web developers to 
ensure that all browsers are provided with the same experience 
when accessing the same webpage. For example: I originally had
 translations for button presses but these were quickly identified
 as a feature not supported by many browsers and replaced in 
 favour of a more universal text colour change on focus and on
 click. If accessed by a browser that does not support certain
 features normally the feature is simply not displayed
</p>

<p>
<b>HTML5 and CSS3 (Current web specifications and standards):</b>
</p>

<p>
Semantic elements: New with HTML5 are semantic elements, elements
 to fulfil a specific purpose and for example the "Header", "footer"
 or "Nav" tags, their purpose is apparent to anyone writing or editing
 code as well as the browser, the header should contain header elements
 etc. These are better than the standard "Div" or "section" tags which 
 don’t provide any description as to the contents and so are already 
 slower and less useful.

 
 </p>
 
 <p>
Another new feature with HTML5 is additional support for rich media 
elements such as the "canvas" or "video" these allow more graphical 
or media based content, such as imbedded videos, or customizers, to be
 included as a standard without the use of plugins like flash player
 this allows for a much richer browsing experience using HTML5

 
 </p>
 <p>
With Css3 there are a lot of new features compared to older versions one
 such feature is media queries, allowing the format of the webpage to 
 change based on many different factors like viewport height, device 
 size and orientation, this allows for the adaptation of webpages that 
 will function appropriately on tablets and smartphones as well as desktops.
 There are 2 approaches to adaptation of webpages for device capability,
 Mobile up and Desktop down. Mobile up begins with everything as a
 default sized and oriented to work on the lowest capable or the smallest
 devices, smartphones, and works its way up as viewport size increases,
 providing alternative styles with media queries like changing a font
 size or colour or reorienting a menu to better fit the viewport. Desktop
 down is the opposite, starting with the largest and working down.

 
 </p>
 <p>
Also new with CSS3 are many new styles to change the look of containers,
 such as a 'border-radius' for the addition of rounded corners, 'Opacity',
 'text shadow', and 'transformations' for repositioning specific elements 
 relative to their starting point. These features again enrich the users 
 browsing experience

 
 </p>
 <p>
As with any updated system, HTML5 and CSS3 come with drawbacks. As HTML5
 and CSS3 have only been the recognised standard for a few years, some
 older browsers are yet to catch up fully and so are only partially 
 compatible or completely incompatible with websites made using the new 
 standards. This defeats the whole purpose of having web standards, with
 the result being that developers must design websites using old standards
 or spend a lot of time and effort developing a website working with both.
 This issue will be fixed with time as old browsers come to support new
 standards or when enough people stop using the old outdated browsers.

 
 </p>
 <p>
Another disadvantage is that with HTML5’s promise of a universally compatible
 multimedia experience it loses some versatility over the previous solution
 of flash player, however this only applies to more advanced features of
 flash player and so is only a small issue.
